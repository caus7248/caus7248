- Hi, I’m Matthew Causley
- I am a Professor at Kettering University. As a research mathematician, I use numerical analysis to devise complex algorithms in the computational of fractional and ordinary differential equations.
- I’m currently learning about data science and machine learning. I am curious about embedding adaptive or Greedy algorithms into various neural networks to enhance learning rates and improve computational efficiency.
- I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning models involving computer vision, time series, and natural language processing. Areas of interest include physics, and perhaps human psychology.
